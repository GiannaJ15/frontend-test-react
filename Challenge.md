# PMG Front End Code Challenge

We are needing to build a Todo list UI. Our designer has put together a basic UI and we need to make the functionality work.

You should code this how you would design the Component hierarchy. But here are some features we want.

1. Ability to type a Todo and hit enter, and immediately be able to type again to add another todo.
2. Click `Done`/`Not Done` buttons to toggle the status of a Todo. This also toggles the Done button to Not Done and vice versa
3. When a Todo is marked `complete` the text should be crossed with a line through it.
4. Click `Remove` button should remove the Todo from the list.
