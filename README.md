> This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


To run this app, you should clone the repo down locally.

Then run `npm install`

Then run `npm run start`

This does assume you have `npm` (Node Package Manager) [installed](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), as well as `git` [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git);
